#CS50x README

This repository is a collection of source code that I wrote for the assignments in Harvard University's CS50x course. The course is hosted by the [Harvard Extension School][19] and is available on the [edx.org][20] Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) platform.

Below is a brief description of the purpose of each week’s assignment, as well as the language(s) the assignment used:

<p><br/></P>

######Week 5 - Data Structures

[Hashtable Spellchecker][9] and [Trie Spellchecker][10]:    Implementing a spell checking program that loads a dictionary file into the specified data structure using File I/O, pointers and dynamic memory allocation and then checks a second file against the dictionary structure outputting total words, misspelled words and spell-checking speed    
<p><br/></P>

######Week 6 - Servers

[server.c][11]:    Parsing request lines to separate the HTTP method, absolute path, optional query, and HTTP version, determining a requested file’s extension and returning the appropriate file type, using File I/O, pointers and dynamic memory allocation to read a file’s contents then store all the bytes contiguously in dynamically loaded memory on the heap    
<p><br/></P>

##HTML5, CSS, PHP, SQL

######Week 7 - Web Programming - Stocks

[public][12], [views][13] and [pset7.sql][14]:    Implementing a stock trading website that allows users to register, login, obtain real time stock quotes from Yahoo Finance, buy and sell stocks based on real time prices, view their portfolio, see their transaction history and change their password
